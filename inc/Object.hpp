/**
 * @brief Common interface for SDL wrapper class.
 *
 * Every wrapper class from Cobra lib is derived from SDL::Object.
 * It is use as a common interace for the wrapper. *e.g*
 * the class propose by default a virtual method for paintEvent.
 * This combine with the fact that SDL::Object are organize as a tree,
 * you simply have to call paintEvent method on root, and every descendant
 * of root will call paintEvent also. Further more, just like Qt framework,
 * SDL::Object as the ability to manage memory for you. *i.e* on delete of
 * an SDL::Object instance, every descendant will be delete also.
 * For example, when you create a SDL::Renderer, the instance is automatically
 * linked to the SDL::Window pass in argument. This mean that when the instance
 * of SDL::Window is destroyed, the renderer will also be destroyed. Finally,
 * the tree is control by two method that are protected. The **joinParent**
 * and **quitParent** methods. Method to *abandon children* are **private**.
 *
 * @note If you don't want your instance to be linked automatically to another
 * instance (for example the renderer with the window), you can subclass the
 * class, and simply call **quitParent** in the constructor. This will ensure
 * that your instance will be un-linked to its parent.
 *
 * @warning Always use on **heap** instance. If you use on **stack** instance,
 * make sure to subclass and un-linked to the parent first. This is because
 * it's not possible to distinguish between on heap and on stack instance,
 * during runtime and compile time. Therefore, if a stack instance as a parent,
 * and this parent is deleted (wheter by scope range or explicitly by delete)
 * before the stack instance child go out of scope, the behavior is
 * undefined. **Always use on heap object** or **subclass base class, un-linked
 * to parent in constructor, and create on stack**.
